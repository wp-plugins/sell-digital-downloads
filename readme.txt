All in one WordPress plugin for selling digital downloads. It allows you to sell digital downloads via PayPal and manage orders from WP dashboard.

== Description ==

Lots of WordPress E-commerce plugins are trying to integrate the digital products selling system into their plugins but that does not work quite well when you try to mix the selling of both physical and digital items together. The setup can get messy and confusing. From my own personal frustrations with those plugins I had decided to create my own plugin for just single purpose, i.e sell and sell only digital products. Also I don't want any kind of bloat in the plugin, so this plugin is not an elephant plugin. If you want to sell digital downloads via PayPal, this plugin will do the job nicely.

WordPress iSell is a simple WordPress plugin to sell digital downloads. It integrates flawlessly with Paypal. User interface (UI) of the plugin is very easy to use, I call this plugin for users, not for developers but developers should not feel left behind. I know how painful it is to modify client's plugins and then know after few weeks or months that they had updated the plugin and boom all changes are lost. There are filters and hooks for almost every important thing in WP iSell. There is also pluggable functions support for some advanced purposes.
